/**
    @class GeoDataPolygon
    @brief A polygon that can have "holes".

    GeoDataPolygon is a tool class that implements the Polygon tag/class
    of the Open Geospatial Consortium standard KML 2.2.

    GeoDataPolygon extends GeoDataGeometry to store and edit Polygons.

    In the QPainter API "pure" Polygons would represent polygons with
    "holes" inside. However QPolygon doesn't provide this feature directly.

    Whenever a Polygon is painted GeoDataLineStyle should be used to assign a
    color and line width.

    The polygon consists of
    @li a single outer boundary and
    @li optionally a set of inner boundaries.

    All boundaries are LinearRings.

    The boundaries of a GeoDataPolygon consist of several (geodetic) nodes which
    are each connected through line segments. The nodes are stored as
    GeoDataCoordinates objects.

    The API which provides access to the nodes is similar to the API of
    QVector.

    GeoDataPolygon allows Polygons to be tessellated in order to make them
    follow the terrain and the curvature of the earth. The tessellation options
    allow for different ways of visualization:

    @li Not tessellated: A Polygon that connects each two nodes directly and
        straight in screen coordinate space.
    @li A tessellated line: Each line segment is bent so that the Polygon
        follows the curvature of the earth and its terrain. A tessellated
        line segment connects two nodes at the shortest possible distance
        ("along great circles").
    @li A tessellated line that follows latitude circles whenever possible:
        In this case Latitude circles are followed as soon as two subsequent
        nodes have exactly the same amount of latitude. In all other places the
        line segments follow great circles.

    Some convenience methods have been added that allow to calculate the
    geodesic bounding box or the length of a Polygon.
